# Fully-Actuated-Behavioral-Control
In this paper, the collision-free formation control issue is investigated for a group of omnidirectional mobile robots with uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. To address this, a fully actuated behavioral control scheme is proposed by integrating the fully actuated system theory into the null-space-based behavioral control method. First, three distributed formation behaviors are developed by transforming the behavioral functions into a fully actuated configuration. Then, the asymptotic stability of these three behaviors and their null-space-based projection fusion are established using Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, a fully actuated sliding mode controller is designed for the over-actuated omnidirectional mobile robots to ensure asymptotic convergence at the dynamic level, thereby enabling the precise tracking of desired kinematic commands in the task space under model uncertainty. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable, revealing the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
